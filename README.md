# STOPWATCH Project

This is a stopwatch project. It is a simple project that I made to learn how to use the JavaScript setInterval() and clearInterval() functions. It's a simple stopwatch that can be started, stopped and reset. 

And also the background animation is inspired by the [background animation](https://codepen.io/mohaiman/pen/MQqMyo) by [Mohaiman](https://codepen.io/mohaiman).

## Future Plans
In future I will add more features to this project like a timer, a countdown timer, a stopwatch with a timer, a stopwatch with a countdown timer.
